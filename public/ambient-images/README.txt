Place background images in this folder and list their filenames (relative) in images.json, e.g. ["sunset.jpg","fog.jpg"].
The app will pick a random image from images.json when Ambient mode is active.
Supported formats: jpg, png, webp.
Do not include path prefixes in images.json; files should live directly in this folder.
